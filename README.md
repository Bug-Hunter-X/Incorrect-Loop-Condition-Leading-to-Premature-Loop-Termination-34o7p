# Incorrect Loop Condition in Java

This repository showcases a common error in Java programming involving the misuse of loop conditions and break statements.  The `BuggyLoop.java` file contains code that demonstrates this error. The `CorrectedLoop.java` file provides the corrected version.

**Bug:** The loop prematurely terminates when the counter `i` reaches 5, not printing the numbers 6-9.

**Solution:** Correcting the loop condition and/or break statement will allow the loop to run to completion.
